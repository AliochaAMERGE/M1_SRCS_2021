Simple Framework
----------------

"Simple is a high performance XML serialization and configuration framework for
 Java. Its goal is to provide an XML framework that enables rapid development 
 of XML configuration and communication systems. This framework aids the 
 development of XML systems with minimal effort and reduced errors. It offers 
 full object serialization and deserialization, maintaining each reference 
 encountered. In essence it is similar to C# XML serialization for the Java 
 platform, but offers additional features for interception and manipulation."
