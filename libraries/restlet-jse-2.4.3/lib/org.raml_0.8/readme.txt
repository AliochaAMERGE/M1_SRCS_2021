RAML - RESTful API Modeling Language
------------------------------------

"RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of 
describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery 
and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. The 
goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and 
then encourage ever-better API patterns. RAML is built on broadly-used 
standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open 
spec."
